## Instructions
Some paths in the scripts are **specific to the original development machine** and must be updated before running the code on your own system.

Please **review and modify the following paths** in each script before use.

###  `video.py`

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO("best.pt") # ðŸ”§ Update this path
video_path = "/datashare/HW1/ood_video_data/surg_1.mp4"  # ðŸ”§ Update this path
output_path = "video_output.avi"                         # Optional: custom output path
```

###  `predict.py`
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
DATA_YAML_PATH = "/tmp/pycharm_project_665/data.yaml" # ðŸ”§ Update this path
SAVE_RESULTS_PATH = "/tmp/pycharm_project_665" # ðŸ”§ Update this path
model = YOLO("model.pt") # ðŸ”§ Update this path
